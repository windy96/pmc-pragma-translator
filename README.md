[Description]
This is a pragma translator for Programmer-Managed Cache (PMC). PMC is a concept that allows programmers to control cache behaviors such as cache coherence. With more knowledge from programmers or programs themselves, PMC provides more opportunities to achieve more energy efficiency.
This translator is based on ROSE compiler infrastructure.
